'''Driller''' – an internet phenomenon, a tracksuit-wearing meme, and living proof that you can have zero real problems and still cosplay a tough guy. Most commonly found on TikTok, stairwells, and in comment sections under music videos, where they threaten people they’ve never seen in their life.

== Definition ==
A driller is an individual who listens to *wannabe gangsta drill* and mistakenly treats the music as a criminal license. Considers himself a representative of “the streets,” even though his biggest life conflict was a Wi-Fi outage or his mom not allowing him to go out after 10 PM.

== Origins ==
Contrary to their own claims, drillers most often come from:
* safe, monitored housing estates with intercoms,
* apartments where dinner is waiting on the table,
* homes with a loving mom calling them back inside after 10 PM (“Kacperek, school tomorrow!”).

Contact with actual street pathology results in an instant loss of “aura” and a sudden urge to become “just a normal guy.”

== Occurrence ==
Drillers are most commonly found:
* on newly built estates with playgrounds,
* in LED-lit bedrooms with ring lights,
* in shopping malls (area: bathrooms and escalators),
* on the internet, where they are at their most dangerous.

In their natural environment, the driller is skittish and avoids real confrontation.

== Appearance ==
A typical driller can be identified by:
* a black tracksuit (clean, branded, bought on sale or at a thrift store),
* a balaclava worn for absolutely no reason,
* a facial expression suggesting constipation or existential ass pain,
* plastic weapons (airsoft, toys, or—at best—a finger shaped like a gun),
* a car: “Hot Wheels Premium Fast & Furious Toyota Supra.”

== Behavior ==
A driller:
* talks about “ops” who are actually classmates that told his mom about his vape,
* flexes crimes he never committed but heard about on TV,
* records more stories than he has thoughts and raps more words than he actually knows (including “lakamakapał chimichimichanga”),
* believes an aggressive beat can replace a personality.

Unlike *true school* culture people—who’ve experienced something more serious than an Instagram ban—drillers are pussies: loud, paper-thin, and falling apart at first contact with reality.

== Psychology ==
According to internet experts, a driller is created by:
* too much internet,
* a lack of real problems worth talking about,
* obsession with image,
* confusing the aesthetics of violence with its consequences.

It’s a form of cosplay—except instead of dragons there are “blocks,” and instead of swords, toy guns.

== Social Reception ==
In society, a driller is seen as:
* a walking joke,
* a hoodie-wearing meme,
* an argument for restricting internet access.

In genuinely street-based environments, they provoke laughter, pity, or the classic “get the fuck out.”

== See Also ==
* TikTok Gangster  
* Gated Community Rapper  
* Internet Tough Guy  
* Violence Cosplay  

== Trivia ==
* A driller loses 90% of his “respect” after removing the hood.
* Most often disappears after hearing “let’s talk.”
* Only dangerous in vertical videos and with comments disabled.

== Summary ==
A driller is not a gangster, not a rapper, and not a rebel. He’s a loud, plastic product of the internet—more posing than substance, more noise than meaning, more hood than backbone.
